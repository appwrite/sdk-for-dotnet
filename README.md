**This SDK is compatible with Appwrite server version latest. For older versions, please check [previous releases](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-dotnet/releases).**

Appwrite is an open-source backend as a service server that abstract and simplify complex and repetitive development tasks behind a very simple to use REST API. Appwrite aims to help you develop your apps faster and in a more secure way. Use the .NET SDK to integrate your app with the Appwrite server to easily start interacting with all of Appwrite backend APIs and tools.

## Installation

### .NET
Add this reference to your project's `.csproj` file:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Appwrite" Version="0.3.0-alpha02" />
```

You can install packages from the command line:

```powershell
# Package Manager
Install-Package Appwrite -Version 0.3.0-alpha02

# or .NET CLI
dotnet add package Appwrite --version 0.3.0-alpha02
```



## Getting Started

### Initialize & Make API Request
Once you add the dependencies, its extremely easy to get started with the SDK; All you need to do is import the package in your code, set your Appwrite credentials, and start making API calls. Below is a simple example:

```csharp
using Appwrite;

static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
  var client = Client();

  client
    .setEndpoint('http://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1') // Make sure your endpoint is accessible
    .setProject('5ff3379a01d25') // Your project ID
    .setKey('cd868c7af8bdc893b4...93b7535db89')
    .setSelfSigned() // Use only on dev mode with a self-signed SSL cert
  ;

  var users = Users(client);

  try {
    var request = await users.create('[USER_ID]', 'email@example.com', 'password', 'name');
    var response = await request.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    Console.WriteLine(response);
  } catch (AppwriteException e) {
    Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
  }
}
```

### Error Handling
The Appwrite .NET SDK raises `AppwriteException` object with `message`, `code` and `response` properties. You can handle any errors by catching `AppwriteException` and present the `message` to the user or handle it yourself based on the provided error information. Below is an example.

```csharp
var users = Users(client);

try {
  var request = await users.create('[USER_ID]', 'email@example.com', 'password', 'name');
  var response = await request.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
  Console.WriteLine(response);
} catch (AppwriteException e) {
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
```
