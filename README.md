**This SDK is compatible with Appwrite server version 1.4.x. For older versions, please check [previous releases](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-dotnet/releases).**

Appwrite is an open-source backend as a service server that abstract and simplify complex and repetitive development tasks behind a very simple to use REST API. Appwrite aims to help you develop your apps faster and in a more secure way. Use the .NET SDK to integrate your app with the Appwrite server to easily start interacting with all of Appwrite backend APIs and tools.

## Installation

### .NET
Add this reference to your project's `.csproj` file:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Appwrite" Version="0.7.1" />
```

You can install packages from the command line:

```powershell
# Package Manager
Install-Package Appwrite -Version 0.7.1

# or .NET CLI
dotnet add package Appwrite --version 0.7.1
```



## Getting Started

### Initialize & Make API Request
Once you have installed the package, it is extremely easy to get started with the SDK; all you need to do is import the package in your code, set your Appwrite credentials, and start making API calls. Below is a simple example:

```csharp
using Appwrite;
using Appwrite.Services;
using Appwrite.Models;

var client = new Client()
  .SetEndpoint("http://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")  
  .SetProject("5ff3379a01d25")                 // Your project ID
  .SetKey("cd868db89");                         // Your secret API key

var users = new Users(client);

var user = await users.Create(
    userId: ID.Unique(),
    email: "email@example.com",
    password: "password",
    name: "name");

Console.WriteLine(user.ToMap());
```

### Error Handling
The Appwrite .NET SDK raises an `AppwriteException` object with `message`, `code`, and `response` properties. You can handle any errors by catching `AppwriteException` and presenting the `message` to the user or handling it yourself based on the provided error information. Below is an example.

```csharp
var users = new Users(client);

try
{
    var user = await users.Create(
        userId: ID.Unique(),
        email: "email@example.com",
        password: "password",
        name: "name");
} 
catch (AppwriteException e)
{
    Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
```

### Preparing Models for Databases API

For the .NET SDK, we use the `Newtonsoft.Json` library for serialization/deserialization support. The default behavior converts property names from `PascalCase` to `camelCase` on serializing to JSON. In case the names of attributes in your Appwrite collection are not created in `camelCase`, this serializer behavior can cause errors due to mismatches in the names in the serialized JSON and the actual attribute names in your collection.

The way to fix this is to add the `JsonProperty` attribute to the properties in the POCO class you create for your model.

For e.g., if you have two attributes, `name` (`string` type) and `release_date` (`DateTime` type), your POCO class would be created as follows:

```csharp
public class TestModel
{
  [JsonProperty("name")]
  public string Name { get; set; }

  [JsonProperty("release_date")]
  public DateTime ReleaseDate { get; set; }
}
```

The `JsonProperty` attribute will ensure that your data object for the Appwrite database is serialized with the correct names.
